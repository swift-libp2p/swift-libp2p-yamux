## Overview
Yamux is a Stream Multiplexer protocol.

Yamux uses a single streaming connection underneath, but imposes message framing so that it can be shared between many logical streams. These logical streams support windowing which provides a soft version of backpressure.

#### Note:
- For more information check out the [YAMUX Spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/yamux/README.md)

## Install

``` swift
let package = Package(
    ...

    ],
